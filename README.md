## :notebook_with_decorative_cover: Notes
- Did not utilize any Prompt Engineering technique :sleeping:
- Probs had to find a way to separate the requirements for each service as each image is built out of all the requirements :sleeping:


## :building_construction: Environment

### :house: You should create a virtualenv
```
## Linux
make virtualenv


## Windows
python -m venv .venv
```


### :factory: How to activate the virtual environment
```
## Linux
source ./.env/bin/activate


## Windows
source ./.venv/Scripts/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### :house_with_garden: How to update the requirements
```
## Linux
make update-requirements-txt


## Windows
cmd.exe /C update_requirements.bat
```


## :hammer: How to close a port that is already in use when trying to run it locally
```
sudo lsof -i :PORT_NUMBER
sudo kill PID
```


## :whale: Docker
#### How to run the multi-container application:
```
## RUN IT ON A SINGLE DOCKER HOST LOCALLY
docker-compose up -d # If the variable is not set, it defaults to stackdemo_local-network, which is the network used for local development
docker-compose logs -f --tail=100 --no-color

## DOWN
docker-compose down --volumes



## RUN IT ON A GROUP OF DOCKER HOSTS THAT ARE JOINED TOGETHER INTO A SINGLE VIRTUAL HOST (SWARM CLUSTER)
docker swarm init
docker service create --name registry --publish published=5000,target=5000 registry:2
export NETWORK_NAME=stackdemo_deployment-network
docker stack deploy --compose-file docker-compose.yml --with-registry-auth --orchestrator swarm mystack

## DOWN
docker stack rm mystack
docker service rm registry
docker swarm leave --force
```

#### Handy commands:
```
## PUSH THE GENERATED IMGS TO THE REGISTRY
docker-compose push

## FIND THE CUSTOM NNETWORKS THAT YOU HAVE CREATED
docker network ls --filter type=custom
```


## ðŸ›  Initialization & Setup
